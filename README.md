# Data Structures and Algorithms

These are some basic implementations of fundamental data structures written by me.

### Testing
1. Write a Python program `driver.py` and import the classes you'd like to test (e.g. `from datastructs import SinglyLinkedList` to import singly linked list data structure)
2. Create objects from imported classes within `driver.py` and call member functions of your choice (e.g. `l = SinglyLinkedList()` to create linked list, `l.insertAtHead(20)` to insert 20 to the head of the list, and `print(l.printList())` to print the linked list).
3. Run `./run.sh` to run `driver.py`
